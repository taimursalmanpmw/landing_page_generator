After reviewing the templates, I believe the best fit for this idea is the "solid" template. The theme of the template is specifically for chocolates, which aligns perfectly with the idea of a basic landing page with a chocolate theme. The template also has a clean and simple design, which will allow us to easily add the message for world peace and the about us section with information on the company's founder, Mr. Alex Buford. Additionally, the FAQs section with popular questions about chocolates can be easily integrated into this template.
