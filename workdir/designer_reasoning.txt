After reviewing the templates, I believe the best fit for this idea is the "solid" template. The theme of the template is "Landing page template" and the description is "A simple website for chocolates." This template seems to match the requirements of the idea, which is a basic landing page with a chocolate theme and a message for world peace. The template also has an "About Us" section and an "FAQs" section, which aligns with the requirements.
